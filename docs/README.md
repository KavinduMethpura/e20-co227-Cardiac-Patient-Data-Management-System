## Introduction

  CardioGuard is a cardiac patient data management system with machine learning. It helps doctors and patients understand the patient's medical condition better, enabling timely and personalized care. The system gives healthcare professionals easy access to patient data for quicker medical attention, while patients can view their health information from anywhere.

## Technology and Implementation

1. **Java and Spring Boot**  
   - The backend was built using Java, fulfilling the requirements of the CO225 module. 
   - Spring Boot, a robust Java framework, was used for its simplicity and ease of setting up a production-ready backend.

2. **React and Tailwind CSS**  
   - React was chosen for the frontend, leveraging its component-based architecture for modular development.
   - Tailwind CSS provided modern styling capabilities that work seamlessly with React, enabling efficient design implementation.

3. **Python for Machine Learning**  
   - Python facilitated the integration of machine learning models into the project.
   - Predictive algorithms were developed to assess the risk of heart failure among patients using data from the system, assisting in proactive healthcare.
